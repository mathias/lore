# lore

A library for procedurally generated text, for use in games, Twitter bots, and other fun things like [NaNoGenMo](https://github.com/NaNoGenMo/). Name comes from the original idea of a building a "lore engine" into a game, to provide textual backstories on the fly. The three components of the system are a [Tracery](tracery.io)-inspired substitution system, a nouns/object system, and an action system for defining what actions can happen to those nouns. Events generated by the noun and action system can be sent to the grammar (substitution) system to turn events into narrative.

Lore is written in Fennel and can be used in Lua projects as well. To use in a Lua project, see the [Embedding docs for Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/tutorial#embedding).


## Usage

Simple example in Fennel:

```
(local lore (:require lore))

(local grammar {:origin "just a simple grammar to test it out!"})

(print (lore.generateOne grammar :origin))
```

Always outputs `just a simple grammar to test it out!`.

See [lore example](https://github.com/mathias/lore-example) for an example of Lore used as a history generator for a made-up game.

## TODO

- [ ] Add an English modifiers function like [Tracey](tracery.io) has.
- [ ] Add the ability to track "objects" and have arbitrary attributes on them, to further make sophisticated generators.
- [ ] Unit tests.
